Legible Gradient Font's color gradients are algorithmically optimized to ensure maximum readability. 
Gradient descent and a classification neural network are used to ensure that each glyph has a unique color gradient pattern, making them easily distinguishable. 
For example, capital "i", lowercase "L", "pipe" ("|"), exclamation mark and lower case "i" (blue on the image) all look distinctively different because they each have unique color gradients. 
Another example are "c" and "o" (green on the image). The c is darker on the left side, while the o is dark on the right side, making them distinguishable. 
The code to create the Legible Gradient Font is open source. The font itself based on the Roboto.
